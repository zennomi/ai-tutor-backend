## Why Rulesync?

### 🧭 **Single Source of Truth**

Author rules once, generate everywhere. Rulesync turns a unified ruleset into tool-native formats so teams stop duplicating instructions across multiple AI assistants.

### 🔧 **Tool Freedom Without Friction**

Let developers pick the assistant that fits their flow—Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code, and more—without rewriting team standards.

### 📦 **Clean, Auditable Outputs**

Rulesync emits plain configuration files you can commit, review, and ship. If you ever uninstall Rulesync, your generated files keep working.

### 🚀 **Fast Onboarding & Consistency**

New team members get the same conventions, context, and guardrails immediately, keeping code style and quality consistent across tools.

### 🧩 **Multi-Tool & Modular Workflows**

Compose rules, MCP configs, commands, and subagents for different tools or scopes (project vs. global) without fragmenting your workflow.

### 🌍 **Ready for What’s Next**

AI tool ecosystems evolve quickly. Rulesync helps you add, switch, or retire tools while keeping your rules intact.
